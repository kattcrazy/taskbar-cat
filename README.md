Taskbar Cat is an idea I've had since August 2024.

It was inspired by RunCat 360, a program that makes a running cat icon appear inside your taskbar and goes faster depending on your cpu speed. My idea was more of a companion, not a pc monitor. I wanted to my OC, my character, watching me as I did whatever I was doing!
I partially implemented this on my website, as you read this you can probably see Starstrike looking at you from the bottom-right corner of your screen (not on mobile, sadly).

And now, just over a year later, I release Taskbar Cat. A small (or large, if you change the size) cat that sits on top of your taskbar and watches you study, relax, and work. 

You can 
- Change the size
- Change the vertical and horizontal positions
- Set it to start on boot
And also easily uninstall or quit the program. To start/install it again, simply open the .exe file.

Microsoft Defender will  warn you when you try to install it, and say that it is unsafe. This is because I haven't gotten a signed certificate for it yet. I assure you it's safe. If you still have doubts, you can take a look a the source code!
